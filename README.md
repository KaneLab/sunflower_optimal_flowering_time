## How to run

### Download input data files

Put all input files in a directory that you make called `data/` in the root of the repository. The scripts will look for the data files in this directory.

1. *sunflower_data_simple_v1.csv* Download this file from Ag Data Commons. Citation with doi.

2. *daymet_timeseries_cleaned.csv* You will need to run the climate scripts to generate this file, which contains climate from the daymet database.

3. *grin_dayflow.csv* Download this data from  GRIN-Global at https://npgsweb.ars-grin.gov/gringlobal/descriptordetail?id=79038 

### Run Scripts

After downloading the above data, you can run the scripts in order. The data derived from these files and resulting figures will be saved in the corresponding folders. All output is already in the repository, so you can skip this step if you just want to look at the results.
